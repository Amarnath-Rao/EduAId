1,**Linear Algebra for Last-Minute Revision**,"This summary covers the key concepts of linear algebra that students need to know for a last-minute revision.

* **Vectors** are mathematical objects that have both magnitude and direction. They can be represented graphically as arrows, and algebraically as ordered lists of numbers.
* **Matrices** are rectangular arrays of numbers. They can be used to represent linear transformations, which are changes in the direction and/or magnitude of vectors.
* **Linear equations** are equations that can be written in the form $Ax = b$, where $A$ is a matrix, $x$ is a vector, and $b$ is a constant vector.
* **Linear independence** is a property of vectors that means they cannot be written as a linear combination of other vectors.
* **Span** is the set of all vectors that can be written as a linear combination of a given set of vectors.
* **Basis** is a set of vectors that spans a vector space and is linearly independent.

These are just a few of the key concepts of linear algebra. For more information, please refer to a textbook or online resource.",http://localhost:5000/images/**Linear Algebra for Last-Minute Revision**.png,http://localhost:5000/audios/**Linear Algebra for Last-Minute Revision**.wav
